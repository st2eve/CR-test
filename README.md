All of it orchestrated and run by Docker Compose.

Make a `docker compose up -d` & the docker env will start.

### Link the database

The first thing to do is to create an empty database in your DB manager. Give it a name. 

The next step is to go the file `wp-config.php` (or rename `wp-config-sample.php`) & write the correct info of your DB to be able to link it with WorkPress.  

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'database_name');

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'pass1234' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'mysql' );
```

> ðŸ‘‰ To allow plugins to be installed on Linux, you must write the following line in your `wp-config.php` file : `define('FS_METHOD','direct');`

### Notes
The Docker Compose file was _initially_ generated by [phpdocker.io](https://phpdocker.io/).
